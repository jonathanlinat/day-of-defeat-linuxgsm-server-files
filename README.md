* **Instant Spawner** (`1.0.0`), Jonathan Linat (https://github.com/jonathanlinat)
   - Completely removes the spawn delay when players die. It allows for a more intense game and works on player death or when they type kill in console.

   - Enhances the deployment mechanism for machine guns in-game.
* **Parachute Provider** (`1.0.0`), Jonathan Linat (https://github.com/jonathanlinat)
   - Provides a parachute to players when they are falling from a height, allowing for a slow and safe descent. Players can activate the parachute by pressing the 'use' key while in mid-air. It contributes to a fun and dynamic gameplay experience in the server.
* **Player Healer** (`1.0.0`), Jonathan Linat (https://github.com/jonathanlinat)

   - Optimizes hit detection for various weapons in the game, ensuring more reliable and consistent registration of hits. It dynamically adjusts the likelihood of a hit being registered based on the type of weapon being used, thereby refining the gameplay experience. The plugin assigns different chances for hits to register based on weapon classes, ranging from melee weapons to heavy firearms, which aims to balance gameplay and align hit registration more closely with player expectations.
