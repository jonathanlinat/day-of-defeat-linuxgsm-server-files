// This section configures the basic maps for map voting. Replace these entries with your preferred maps to ensure they automatically show up in votes when nominations don't fill the slots. Ideally, define a minimum of 10 maps, though 15 or 20 is recommended for variety. If left empty, the plugin defaults to using the mapcycle.txt file.
