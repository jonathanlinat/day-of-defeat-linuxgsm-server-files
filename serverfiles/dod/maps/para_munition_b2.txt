1944, Undisclosed location

After a swift assault, the German Waffen-SS has overtaken a small town, leaving behind ammunition boxes for an expected rearguard. However, a few American GIs managed to evade capture.

Anticipating a countermove by the US Army to reclaim the ammunition, the German command dispatches an elite unit of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) via Luftwaffe airdrop to secure the area and protect the vital supplies.
