1943, Sicily

The Allies retreated from a key village, setting the stage for a calculated comeback.
This strategic withdrawal led to the initiation of Operation: Saints, a counteroffensive
aimed at recapturing the lost territory. Named to embody the resilience and resolve of
the Allied forces, Operation: Saints represented a pivotal moment in their Sicilian
campaign, marking a determined effort to regain control and momentum.
