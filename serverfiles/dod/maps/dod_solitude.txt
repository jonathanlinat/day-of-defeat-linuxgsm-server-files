1942, Undisclosed location

In the heart of a secluded village, combatants from opposing forces find themselves in
a relentless battle for supremacy. Dubbed Operation: Flag Dominion, this skirmish
focuses on strategic agility and sharpshooting prowess. The village, with its narrow
alleys and rustic charm, transforms into a battleground where every corner could spell
victory or defeat.
