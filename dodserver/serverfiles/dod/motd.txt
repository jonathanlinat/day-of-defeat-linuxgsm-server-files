<p>Welcome to <i>Day of Defeat</i>.
<i>Day of Defeat</i> is a World War II multiplayer game driven by the Half-life
engine. DoD attempts to recreate WWII battles in both fictional and
non-fictional environments - the game puts you in the shoes (rather, combat
boots!) of a British, American or German soldier circa 1944, Western Europe.</p>
<p class="white">You can visit DoD at: <a href="http://www.dayofdefeat.net/">http://www.dayofdefeat.net/</a></p>
