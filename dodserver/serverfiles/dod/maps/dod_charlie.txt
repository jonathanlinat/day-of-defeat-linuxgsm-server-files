Today is the turning point of the war! Failure is
not an option - move up the beach, or perish!

Allied Objectives:
   - Destroy the sea wall to move up the beach
   - Destroy the two 88 'flak' guns
   - Destroy the Axis radio tower
   - Destroy the artillery bunker

Axis Objectives:
   - Defend the beach
   - Once the beach defenses are breached, fall back and defend
