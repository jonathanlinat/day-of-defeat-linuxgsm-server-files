DOD_HEUTAU by Florian "floMatic" Plischkowsky & Michael "sector-effector" Goemmel

As the Invasion neared its end, 
there was only one barrier left to prevent 
the Allied Forces from entering 
the southern regions of the Reich: 
the Chiemgau Region with the key city Heutau, 
the Wehrmachtï¿½s last real stronghold.
