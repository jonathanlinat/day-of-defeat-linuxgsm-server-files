Operation Diversion: The Battle for Burha

During Operation Market Garden, a small
Allied force diverted from the main assault
to capture the town of Burha, left with
little damage and still standing, to divert
attention away from the key Cities of Arnhem
and Hanover. The Germans have misinterperated
the diversion as a full out attack and have
sent a force to stop the Allied Advance.

Capture all 5 flags to capture the town of Burha.
